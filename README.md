# Kanban
Kanban is a project management methodology that allows for organizing and prioritizing
projects and their tasks, using boards, lists, and cards. With the right Kanban board software,
managers can focus on managing and prioritizing the team’s tasks, keep the team in the loop,
and control a steady workflow. This tool supports agile development and helps visualizing and
managing the workflow.
